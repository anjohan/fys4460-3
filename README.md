# fys4460-3
Files for the percolation project in FYS4460 at the University of Oslo, with implementations in (modern) Fortran.

lib/clusterlabelling.f90 contains various useful functions and subroutines for percolation, including the implementation of a stupid algorithm for labelling clusters in a binary (logical) square matrix.
