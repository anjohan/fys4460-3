	abstract = {We present an efficient run-based two-scan algorithm for labeling connected components in a binary image. Unlike conventional label-equivalence-based algorithms, which resolve label equivalences between provisional labels, our algorithm resolves label equivalences between provisional label sets. At any time, all provisional labels that are assigned to a connected component are combined in a set, and the smallest label is used as the representative label. The corresponding relation of a provisional label and its representative label is recorded in a table. Whenever different connected components are found to be connected, all provisional label sets concerned with these connected components are merged together, and the smallest provisional label is taken as the representative label. When the first scan is finished, all provisional labels that were assigned to each connected component in the given image will have a unique representative label. During the second scan, we need only to replace each provisional label by its representative label. Experimental results on various types of images demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms all conventional labeling algorithms.},

	abstract = {A new approach for the determination of the critical percolation concentration, percolation probabilities, and cluster size distributions is presented for the site percolation problem. The novel "cluster multiple labeling technique" is described for both two- and three-dimensional crystal structures. Its distinctive feature is the assignment of alternate labels to sites belonging to the same cluster. These sites are members of a simulated finite random lattice. An algorithm useful for the determination of the critical percolation concentration of a finite lattice is also presented. This algorithm is especially useful when applied in conjunction with the cluster multiple labeling technique. The basic features of this technique are illustrated by applying it to a small planar square lattice. Numerical results are given for a triangular subcrystal containing up to 9 000 000 sites. These results compare favorably with the exact value of the infinite lattice critical percolation concentration.},

A persistent anisotropy in the distribution of {SCB} is found and used to estimate the ratio between the bulk and shear moduli of a random percolating system. Local anisotropy in the direction of {SCB} disappears for large L.},

	abstract = {Percolation is the simplest fundamental model in statistical mechanics that exhibits phase transitions signaled by the emergence of a giant connected component. Despite its very simple rules, percolation theory has successfully been applied to describe a large variety of natural, technological and social systems. Percolation models serve as important universality classes in critical phenomena characterized by a set of critical exponents which correspond to a rich fractal and scaling structure of their geometric features. In this review we will first outline the basic features of the ordinary model and take a glimpse at a number of selective variations and modifications of the original model. Directed percolation process will be also discussed as a prototype of systems displaying a nonequilibrium phase transition. After a short review on {SLE}, we will provide an overview on existence of the scaling limit and conformal invariance of the critical percolation. We will also establish a connection with the magnetic models. Recent applications of the percolation theory in natural and artificial landscapes are also reviewed.},

	abstract = {We derive exact relations that allow us to describe unambiguously and quantitatively the structure of clusters near the percolation threshold p c . In particular, we prove the relations p(dp,,/dp) = (Aa,) where p is the bond density, p , , is the pair connectedness function and (Az,) is the average number of cutting bonds between i and j . These bonds have the property such that if one is cut, i and j are no longer connected. From this relation it follows that the average number of cutting bonds between two points separated by a distance of the order of the connectedness length [, diverges as Ip-{pCI}-’. The remaining (multiply connected) bonds in the percolating backbone, which lump together in ‘blobs’,diverge with a dimensionality-dependent exponent. In the light of these results, the backbone of the infinite cluster near p c is better described by a ‘nodes, links and blobs’ picture, rather than the simplified Skal-Shklovskii-de Gennes ‘nodes and links’ model.},
